UH-Uni-Verse

Motivation: For this app I am trying to create a space where all UH students can connect. The main target would be new students who need help with deciding on classes, or learning things about life in Hawaii. I think that the University of Hawaii is one of the harder colleges to adapt to because it is very far for a lot of people and its disconnected from the mainland. I think this app would create a great place to help all these students.

Goals: create a easy to use environment that allows students to easily connect to other students, find out information about classes and other needs they may have.

Usage: data file has been updated and now uses riverpod, you must now enter a valid UH email to enter the app. As of right now it is functional with my email (zp6@hawaii.edu) and an example one (user1@hawaii.edu). UI and features are still pretty bare bones but the groundwork is set. Data is a little wrong here and there, but will be easy for me to edit in the future.
