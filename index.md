# UH-Uni-Verse

Motivation: For this app I am trying to create a space where all UH students can connect. The main target would be new students who need help with deciding on classes, or learning things about life in Hawaii. I think that the University of Hawaii is one of the harder colleges to adapt to because it is very far for a lot of people and its disconnected from the mainland. I think this app would create a great place to help all these students.

Goals: create a easy to use environment that allows students to easily connect to other students, find out information about classes and other needs they may have.

Usage: App now has more features and the basic UI for nearly all of the pages are up. Everything is linked to a standard data file with base values that I can edit. There is a Profile page, CLass page, Explore page, and a non functional messages page.
