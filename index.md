# UH-Uni-Verse.github.io

Motivation: For this app I am trying to create a space where all UH students can connect. The main target would be new students who need help with deciding on classes, or learning things about life in Hawaii. I think that the University of Hawaii is one of the harder colleges to adapt to because it is very far for a lot of people and its disconnected from the mainland. I think this app would create a great place to help all these students.

Goals: create a easy to use environment that allows students to easily connect to other students, find out information about classes and other needs they may have.

Usage: Currently the app is in its bare bones stages. There is a login screen and a drawer that links to all the pages the app will have. Each page has a description of what the page will do.
