UH-Universe Usability Evaluation Design


User goals:
Connect to other students
Easy access to information about classes and professors
Easy access to clubs and other social groups

Scenarios:

1. You are a new student at UH and you want to connect with people in your class to form study groups, make friends, etc. You can use the app to see who is in your class with similar interests or the same major. Connecting with these people can make the transition to UH a lot more smooth.

2. You are a student at UH and you have no idea what a certain class is like. Maybe you have trouble learning in certain environments (ie: lecture based, group work, etc.). There is only so much an advisor can tell you about a class, so you use the app to get into contact with students that have taken the class, or the professors of the class to get an inside perspective on the workload or teaching style.

3. You are a student at UH that is looking to join an extracurricular club or group. Especially for smaller groups or clubs it may be difficult to get the word out about it. The app provides an easy way for you to learn about clubs and social groups on campus and an easy way for people to promote their clubs/social groups


User types:
New University of Hawaii students
Returning University of Hawaii students

Recruitment:
Ask friends/teammates that attend the University of Hawaii to test out my app. Should be able to find at least 10 people to evaluate the app through that avenue.

THE INSTRUCTIONS
❑ The mobile device open to Home screen
Hi, ___________. My name is ___________, and I’m 
going to be walking you through this session today.
Before we begin, I have some information for you, and 
I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything.
You probably already have a good idea of why we asked 
you here, but let me go over it again briefly. We’re 
asking people to try using a mobile app that we’re 
working on so we can see whether it works as intended. 
The session should take about an hour.
The first thing I want to make clear right away is that 
we’re testing the app, not you. You can’t do anything 
wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today 
where you don’t have to worry about making mistakes. 
As you use the app, I’m going to ask you as much as 
possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re 
looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re 
thinking. This will be a big help to us.
Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our 
feelings. We’re doing this to improve it, so we need to 
hear your honest reactions.

If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. 
I may not be able to answer them right away, since 
we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have 
someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still 
have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to answer 
them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, 
just let me know.
With your permission, we’re going to record what 
happens on the screen and our conversation. The 
recording will only be used to help us figure out how to 
improve the app, and it won’t be seen by anyone except 
the people working on this project. And it helps me, 
because I don’t have to take as many notes. 
Also, there are a few people from the design team 
observing this session in another room. (They can’t see 
us, just the screen.)
If you would, I’m going to ask you to sign a simple 
permission form for us. It just says that we have your 
permission to record you, and that the recording will 
only be seen by the people working on the project. 
❑ Give them a recording permission form and a pen 
❑ While they sign it, START the SCREEN RECORDER 
on your laptop
Do you have any questions so far?

THE QUESTIONS
OK. Before we look at anything, I’d like to ask you just 
a few quick questions. 
First, what’s your occupation? What do you do all day?
What kind of mobile device (or devices) do you use, like 
smartphones or a tablet? 
What kinds of things do you spend time doing on your 
mobile devices? 
Do you have any favorite mobile apps?

THE FIRST SCREEN TOUR
OK, great. We’re done with the questions, and we can 
start looking at things.
First, I’m going to ask you to open up the app labeled UH Uni-Verse.
Now, before you start doing anything, just look at the 
first screen and tell me what you make of it: what strikes 
you about it, what you think you can do with it, and 
what it’s for. Just look around and do a little narrative.
You can scroll if you want, but please don’t “click” (or 
tap) on anything yet.
❑ Allow this to continue for two or three minutes, at most.

THE TASKS
Thanks. Now I’m going to ask you to try doing some 
specific tasks. I’m going to read each one out loud and 
give you a printed copy.
I’m also going to ask you to do these tasks without using 
Search. We’ll learn a lot more about how well the site 
works that way.
And again, as much as possible, it will help us if you can 
try to think out loud as you go along.
❑ Hand the participant the first scenario, and read it 
aloud.
❑ Allow the user to proceed until you don’t feel like it’s 
producing any value or the user becomes very 
frustrated.
❑ Repeat for each task or until time runs out.

PROBING
Thanks, that was very helpful.
If you’ll excuse me for a minute, I’m just going to see if 
the people on the team have any follow-up questions 
they’d like me to ask you.
❑ Call the observation room to see if the observers have 
any questions.
❑ Ask the observers’ questions, then probe anything you 
want to follow up on.
WRAPPING UP
Do you have any questions for me, now that we’re 
done?
❑ Give them their incentive, or remind them it will be 
sent to them.
❑ Stop the screen recorder and save the file.
❑ Thank them and escort them out

"Raw" Data:
Participant A: Evaluated app on my device. 
Scenario 1 (connect with UH students in your class): Logged in without issue. Participant had to scroll down to find the class he was looking for. I had to direct him to the class description page. Once told where the class description page was, he easily found a list of students in the class he asked for. When it came to contacting them, he would have had to search their emails up on a seperate window to contact them.

Participant B: Evaluated app on my device.
Scenario 2 (use the app to learn about a class): Logged in without issue. Participant selected a class randomly from the home page to learn about. Easily found a description of the class and the professors contact information. Participant had to go to external site to contact a student after finding their email. 

Participant C: Evaluated app on my device
Scenario 3 (trying to learn about a club or group): Participant tried to press enter to login, only the button worked, had to be told to press the button. Participant had to be directed to the club page. After on the club page, easily found a random club to be a part of and found the basic information and contact information of the leader.

Participant D: Evaluated app on my device.
Scenario 1 (connect with UH students in your class): Participant tried to press enter to login, had to be told only the button worked. Was able to find his class in the scrolldown menu without direction. Navigated to the class page without problem. Was able to find the names of some students in his class.

Participant E: Evaluated app on my device.
Scenario 2 (use the app to learn about a class): Paricipant logged in without issue. Participant clicked on a random class to learn about. Participant was able to find the professors name and email to contact. Participant then said he would want to look up the professor on a different tab, then email some of the students whos names were under the class to ask about the class.



"results":
- Using enter to login was a small problem discovered, seems to be an instict for some people implementing enter as an option to login would enhance the experience for users.
    - https://github.com/UH-Uni-Verse/App/issues/20
- Seemed to take a little long when the participants were looking for a specific class on the list, implementing a search function would speed this process up significantly
    - https://github.com/UH-Uni-Verse/App/issues/21
- Participants had to go to external tabs to contact students and to learn about professors. Adding messaging and more professor info (rate my professor score, etc.) would save users time.
    - https://github.com/UH-Uni-Verse/App/issues/22
- Some participants had trouble navigating the app, maybe adding more lables for things would help this process.
